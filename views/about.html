            <p>
              The Duquesne Incline has a fascinating history dating back to the mid-19th century. Originally constructed in the 1870s, it was one of the first solutions to the transportation challenges faced by a rapidly growing Pittsburgh. At its inception, the incline served both as an innovative means of overcoming the steep hill between the river and Mount Washington and as a crucial component in the city’s industrial expansion.
